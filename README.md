##create-react-app
The starter kit for creating front-end react apps: [Installation: Creating a new application](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#creating-a-new-application)  
  
"Create React App doesn't handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. It uses build tools like Babel and webpack under the hood, but works with zero configuration."
